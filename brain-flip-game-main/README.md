# Brain Flip Game ðŸ§ 

A fun puzzle game where you have to do the opposite of what you see! When the game shows "UP", you click "DOWN". When it shows "RED", you click "GREEN". It sounds simple, but gets tricky fast as the timer gets shorter and the instructions get more complex.

## What I Built

This is a web game I made to practice my React and TypeScript skills. I wanted to create something that was actually fun to play, not just another todo app. The game has:

- **3 Game Modes**: Classic (60 seconds), Duel (45 seconds), and Sudden Death (90 seconds)
- **Real-time Leaderboards**: See how you rank against other players
- **Daily Challenges**: New puzzles every day to keep you coming back
- **Achievements**: Unlock badges as you get better at the game
- **Works Offline**: You can install it like a phone app and play anywhere

## How to Play

1. **Start a game** - Pick your mode and difficulty
2. **Read the instruction** - It might say "UP" or "BLUE" or "TAP"
3. **Do the opposite** - If it says "UP", click the down button
4. **Get faster** - The timer gets shorter as you progress
5. **Beat your score** - Try to get the highest score possible!

## Tech Stuff

I used:
- **Next.js 14** - For the framework and routing
- **React 18** - For the UI components
- **TypeScript** - To catch bugs before they happen
- **Tailwind CSS** - For styling (I'm not great at CSS so this helps)
- **Framer Motion** - For smooth animations
- **Supabase** - For user accounts and leaderboards
- **Zustand** - For managing game state

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the dev server
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:3000
```

## What I Learned

This project taught me a lot about:
- Building complex game logic in React
- Managing real-time data with Supabase
- Making animations smooth and performant
- Testing game mechanics (turns out games are hard to test!)
- Making things accessible for everyone

## Future Ideas

I'm thinking about adding:
- Multiplayer battles between friends
- More puzzle types (maybe math or word puzzles)
- Custom themes and skins
- Mobile app versions

This was a fun project to build! Games are way more interesting than CRUD apps. Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions for improvements.
